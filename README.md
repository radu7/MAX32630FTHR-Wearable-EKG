# MAX32630FTHR-Wearable-EKG
My first extensive foray into embedded systems. A wearable ekg system designed using Maxim's MAX32630FTHR development board and the Texas Instruments ADS1291 EKG analog front end. This project was created using ARM's mbed online ide.

This project will remain as is as documentation, but may be continued in another repo at a future date.
